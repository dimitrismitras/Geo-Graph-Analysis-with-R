The project involves various geocomputations using raster &amp; shape files.

In this project, is analyzed a raster file (.tif) containing elevation data for the Mediterranean, along with three shape files containing information about capitals, states, and places in Greece. The project involves various geocomputations using these files, and new data will be added to create additional interesting maps by the end.
